INSTALL

To install tk-goodies just follows the usual steps:

1) ./configure
2) make install

The installed icons package has an icons.xml file
which basedir is setted to "." so you'll have to
place your icon-sets in the same directory as icons
package. If you want, do so otherwise properly set
basedir to point to the dir containing your icon-sets.

To use icons you need a Tango compilant icon-set, you
can use for example the one you find at the following
url.
http://art.gnome.org/themes/icon/1150

You can try to make your own icon-set Tango compilant
using the naming-tools provided by the Tango project;
take a look at the following url for more info.
